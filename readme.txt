Why is this app in the Community Store?
This app was written by Lennart Kuijs. As Lennart is currently unable to work on the app I (Adrian Rockall) will try to maintain it for now.
So version 1.6.0 onwards has additional devices and bug fixes by me and those submitted to GitHub by other developers.
