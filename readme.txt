With this app it's possible to connect your Somfy TaHoma or Connexoon box to Homey and control your scenarios and devices / sensors directly from Homey.

Use the power of Homey flows to automate your Somfy devices.

Recently re-written to fully comply with Somfy's new guidelines, so you can use the app with peace of mind.
